/**
 `NAKPlaybackIndicatorView` is a view that mimics the music playback indicator in the Music.app on iOS 7.

 It has three vertical bars and they oscillate randomly.
 The color of the bars can be changed by setting `tintColor` property (`UIView`) of the receiver or its ancestor view.

 Out of the box it works well with Auto Layout system as it provides sensible layout information
 such as intrinsic content size, baseline, and priorities of content hugging / compression resistence.
 Of course, it can work with frame-based layout system also.

 The current state of the receiver.

 You can control the receiver's appearance and behavior by setting this property.

 - `NAKPlaybackIndicatorViewStateStopped`:
   - If hidesWhenStopped is `YES`, the receiver becomes hidden.
   - If hidesWhenStopped is `NO`, the receiver shows idle bars (same as `NAKPlaybackIndicatorViewStatePaused`).
 - `NAKPlaybackIndicatorViewStatePlaying`: The receiver shows oscillatory animated bars.
 - `NAKPlaybackIndicatorViewStatePaused`: The receiver shows idle bars.

 The initial value is `NAKPlaybackIndicatorViewStateStopped`.
